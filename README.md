## Why The Sounds Player?

Foundry VTT's default playlist system lacks essential features for smooth audio management during sessions. **The Sounds Player** fills this gap with:

### 🎵 **Full Timeline Navigation**
Ergonomic seeking for audio playback. Click on the timeline to jump to any position - no more waiting for a track to finish or restarting from the beginning.

### 🎨 **Visual Slot System with Custom Images**
Assign custom images to each sound slot for instant visual recognition. Perfect for distinguishing between combat themes, ambient sounds, and NPC themes at a glance.
